Setting up Encrypted Instant Messaging
======================================


Making secure and private communications with our friends and colleagues is important. In the recent years many providers are trying to advertise their product as private and secure. Using a service that uses end-to-end encryption protocol is recommended since providers can't read your messages.


One other important factor to consider is using an application that is open source. Being open source has the advantage of being transparent. Other developers could audit the app and check for vulnerabilities.


Some products may use strong encryption but if their software is closed source, there might be a backdoor so find an alternative.


Remember that using an encrypted communication doesn't hide the fact that you're communicating with another person, it just hides the content of your communication from other people.



What is Signal?
---


Signal is an instant messaging, voice calling and video calling app that uses end-to-end encryption to encrypt all communications therefore it's very difficult for a third-party to intercept your communications.



Why Signal?
---


If you want to communicate with someone, it is far easier to use an application such as Signal. Compared to Signal, PGP is not friendly for beginners.


Misconfiguration in PGP can lead to unsecure communication as well but since using Signal is fairly easy, you don't have to worry about misconfiguration. Just install the app and use it for your communications.


Signal is also open source and free and it has been audited and probed by security researchers.


Android - Installing Signal
------------------------------


To install Signal on your Android device, open Google Play Store and search for "Signal". After the installation, launch Signal.


When you launch Signal for the first time it asks for your phone number. Enter your phone number. If you don't want to use your personal number create a virtual number and use that.

Signal will send you a verification code. Enter that code to verify your phone number. You will be asked to choose a profile picture and profile name.
