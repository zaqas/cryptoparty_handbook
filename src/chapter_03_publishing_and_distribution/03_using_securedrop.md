Using SecureDrop
===

SecureDrop was originally designed under the name and it aims to provide a secure way for whistleblowers to send documents to journalists and news agencies.

Many big news agencies around the world use SecureDrop. (such as The Intercept, The Guardian, The New York Times, ProPublica, etc.)


SecureDrop uses Tor network for anonymisation and security therefore SecureDrop sites are only accessible through onion sites.

Before sending any file to any organization, remember to scrub the metadata. If you're using Tails, there is a toolkit named "Metadata Anonymisation".

To use SecureDrop you should use public wifi networks and not use computers in a Internet caf√© or those controlled by your employee. CCTV cameras and other people nearby can see what you're doing as well, so be cautious!

Things to consider
---

If your machine is compromised, your communication through SecureDrop may be compromised as well. Remember that being a whistleblower carries risks and there is no way to eliminate all risks.

Try to compartmentalize. Don't use your previous social media accounts, pre-existing email accounts, etc.

SecureDrop doesn't guarantee your anonymity. If you're trying to leak documents, your adversary will use your search history, visited websites, Signal or WhatsApp messages, and everything you left behind.
