Social Media
===

Keeping a social media private in this day and age is very difficult since their business model is 'Surveillance Capitalism' and these companies try to collect as much information as possible. Even after setting up an account anonymously (using a pseudonym, using throw-away email, using Tor to connect to this account), the website will try to collect data on you. The pages you visit, how many minutes you spend on each page, what posts you like and people you follow are all used to create a profile on you.

Facebook and Google are known to be invasive when it comes to privacy but some people undermine Twitter's role. We cover how Twitter invades your privacy and collects data on you.

For example in 2019, the Justice Department accused two employees of Twitter of using their positions and their access to Twitter’s internal systems to aid Saudi Arabia by obtaining information on American citizens and Saudi dissidents who opposed the policies of the kingdom and its leaders.

A year later, major accounts owned by people like Barack Obama, Jeff Bezos and Bill gates and other prominent leaders and businessmen got hacked as well.

The employees at these social media have access to all of the information that is collected about you and if you're an activist targeted by a nation-state this could be very dangerous. 



### Twitter



Using Twitter anonymously has become difficult recently since it asks for phone numbers. If you succeed to sign up without a phone number, they will ask your phone number in a week or so.

If Twitter asked your phone number and you didn't want to buy a pre-paid SIM card to sign up, just say that you don't own a phone. Be respectful and persistent and they will activate your account.

Go to your privacy settings and disable settings that allow other people to find you by your email address or your phone number. Stay away from direct messages. Use your account only to tweet and don't share personal information. If you have a personal account on Twitter, don't follow that account. If you're logged in as your personal account don't check your other account.

You should read Twitter's 'Terms of Service' and 'Privacy Policy' at least once. Here are some takeaways:

- Your timezone and language, application and version of Twitter you use, Time and date of creation of your account are public.

- Tweets are viewable and searchable by anyone around the world.

- Even If you're looking at Tweets, Twitter will gather personal information from you (the type of device you're using, your ip address)

- Twitter will use content you've read, liked or retweeted to determine your favorite subjects, the languages you speak to show you relevant content.

- Twitter stores your current precise position or places where you've previously used Twitter.

- Twitter uses cookies to collect additional information.

- The log data includes information such as: IP address, browser type, operating system, the referring web page, page visited, location, your mobile carrier, device information, search terms, cookie information.

- Keep in mind that search engines and other third parties may still retain copies of your public information even after you have deleted the information from our services or deactivated your account.


Since your direct messages are not encrypted, employees at Twitter are capable of seeing your conversations. In 2019, The Justice Department accused two employees of Twitter of using their positions and their access to Twitter’s internal systems to aid Saudi Arabia by obtaining information on American citizens and Saudi dissidents who opposed the policies of the kingdom and its leaders.


### Instagram

It's been reported that Instagram (owned by Facebook) collects lots of information on it users. When you sign up you give up your email address and phone number to Facebook. In addition to this there is an on-going monitoring that tracks your every move like what profiles you visit, what posts you like, etc. 


It's been reported that Instagram tried to activate devices camera on iOS  14 without user's knowledge. Although Facebook later blamed this action on a bug, Facebook can't be trusted when it comes to your privacy. Some people have said when they talked about a subject to a close friend and their smartphone was nearby, they received an advertisement the next day in regard to the personal conversation they had. 

Even if you deleted Instagram, Facebook would still track you over the internet and have a "shadow" profile on you. Take the necessary steps to protect yourself from Facebook since they publicly have said you shouldn't expect privacy when you use their service.

### TikTok

TikTok is the fastest growing social media and there has been speculation that they share information with chinese intelligence services. As written in their privacy policy they collect information which includes IP address, location, user content and communication, device identifiers and other sensitive information about users.

It seems that TikTok's app even tries to collect sensitive information such as passwords, cryptocurrency wallet addresses, account-reset links, and personal messages. TikTak is also considered to be insecure since it relies on HTTP to transport sensitive data over the Internet.

If you want to read more about what type of information they collect you should read TikTok's policy as any other service you sign up for. The most important lesson to learn is that no app should be trusted and you should always be careful about what information you give away since your information will be stored somewhere in the world and when you request account deletion you can't be certain that your data is gone.



### Final note
---

If you really care about your privacy and want to protect it you should stay off social media platforms but in some cases it may be a good idea to use a platform to publish something but be aware that these platforms try to collect informtaion about you even when you give them fake information. The size of your monitor, your IP address, posts you like, the amount of time spent on each page all could be used to identify you.

If you're trying to publish a document on Twitter, create an account just for publishing that document and don't use it for other activities.

Be aware that stylometry could be used to analyze your posts. Don't get into arguments with other users and don't discuss anything personal. Don't talk about weather, your health, education, job, etc.
