Keeping passwords safe
======================

Passwords are like keys in the physical world. If you lose a password you will not be able to get in, and if others copy or steal it they can use it to enter. A good password should not be easy for others to guess and not easy to crack with computers. If you have all of your passwords in your mind, you have poor password.


Password length and complexity
------------------------------

To protect your passwords from being guessed, length and complexity are important. Passwords like the name of your pet or a birth date are very unsafe, as is using single word that can be found in a dictionary. Do not use a password containing only numbers. Most importantly a secure password is long. Using combinations of lower case letters, capitals, numbers and special characters can improve the security, but length is still the most important factor.

For use with important accounts like the passphrase which protects your PGP/GPG or VeraCrypt encrypted data, or the password for your main email account, use 20 characters or more, the longer the better.

Easy to remember and secure passwords
-------------------------------------

One way to create strong and easy to remember passwords is to Diceware technique. This method allows you to create strong passwords using dice and a list of Diceware words.
You can find the list [here](https://www.eff.org/files/2016/07/18/eff_large_wordlist.txt).

A few examples:

 * `cleft cam synod lacy yr wok`
 * `dobbs bella bump flash begin ansi`
 * `easel venom aver flung jon call`
 * `bang vivo thread duct knob train`

Sentences are easy to remember, even if they are 50 characters long and contain uppercase characters, lowercase characters, symbols and numbers.

All you need to do is to roll the dice several times and write down the numbers you get.

If you roll the number five, then two, then three again, then one, then six, and then look up in the Diceware word list 52316, you’ll see the word “ritzy” That will be the first word in your passphrase. Now you have to repeat.

How strong are Diceware passphrases?
-------------------------------------------

The strength of your passphrase depends on how many words you are using, the more words the stronger your password. To check the strength of your password use this website: [https://howsecureismypassword.net/](https://howsecureismypassword.net/)

Minimizing damage
-----------------

It is important to minimize the damage if one of your passwords is ever compromised. Use different passwords for different websites or accounts, that way if one is compromised, the others are not. Change your passwords from time to time, especially for accounts you consider to be sensitive. By doing this you can block access to an attacker who may have learned your old password.

Using a password manager
-------------------------------------------

Remembering a lot of different passwords can be difficult. One solution is to use a dedicated application to manage most of your passwords.  Generally there are two types of password managers:

- Offline Password Managers (e.g. KeePassXC)
- Online Password Managers (e.g. LastPass)


The next section in this chapter will discuss *KeePassXC*, a free and open source password manager with no known vulnerabilities, so long as you chose a sufficiently long and complex "master password" to secure it with. Then we're going to discuss Bitwarden. When you're using Bitwarden, If you create a unique password for an account, that password will sync between your devices but since KeePassXC is an offline password manager this doesn't happen. With online password managers you have the added benefit of having access to your passwords wherever you go, at the disadvantage of lower security.



Physical protection
-------------------

When using a public computer such as at a library, an internet cafe, or any computer you do not own, there are several dangers. Using "over the shoulder" surveillance, someone, possibly with a camera, can watch your actions and may see the account you log in to and the password you type. A less obvious threat is software programs or hardware devices called "keystroke loggers" that record what you type. They can be hidden inside a computer or a keyboard and are not easily spotted. Do not use public computers to log in to your private accounts, such as email. If you do, change your passwords as soon as you get back to a computer you own and trust.

Other caveats
-------

Some applications such as chat or mail programs may ask you to save or "remember" your username and password, so that you don't have to type them every time the program is opened. Doing so may mean that your password can be retrieved by other programs running on the machine, or directly from your hard disk by someone with physical access to it. It's recommended to use a dedicated password manager instead of saving your passwords in a browser.

If your login information is sent over an insecure connection or channel, it might fall into the wrong hands. See the chapters on secure browsing for more information.

Use Your Personal Device
-------

If you're creating unique passwords for each account, remember to do this on your personal device not on someone else's device or while you're staying at a hotel or while you're having a drink at a cafe. Public machines may have keyloggers or other spyware that you're not aware of and it would be better to use a personal machine which is free of malware and spyware.

Before installing a password manager you should wipe your machine or at least scan your computer by an antivirus to make sure it's not infected.
