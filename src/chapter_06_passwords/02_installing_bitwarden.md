Installing Bitwarden
==================

Bitwarden is a password manager that works on most operating systems. You can easily store your passwords and keep them synced between all of your devices.

Bitwarden stores your logins in an encrypted vault. Since it's encrypted not even Bitwarden's employees can access your logins, only you can access them. Your data is sealed with AES-256 bit encryption, salted hashing, and PBKDF2 SHA-256.

One other advantage of Bitwarden in comparison to password managers like LastPass is that it's open source.
