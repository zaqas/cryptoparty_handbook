Tracking
========

When you browse the web tiny digital traces of your presence are left behind. Many web sites harmlessly use this data to compile statistics and see how many people are looking at their site and which pages are popular, but some sites go further and use various techniques to track individual users, even going as far as trying to identify them personally. It does not stop there however. Some firms store data in your web browser which can be used to track you on other web sites. This information can be compiled and passed on to other organizations without your knowledge or permission.

This all sounds ominous but really who cares if some big company knows about a few web sites that we have looked at? Big web sites compile and use this data for "behavioral advertising" where ads are tailored to fit your interests exactly. That's why after looking at say, the Wikipedia entry for Majorca, one may suddenly start seeing lots of ads for packaged vacations and party hats. This may seem innocent enough, but after doing a search for "Herpes Treatments" or "Fetish Communities" and suddenly seeing listings for relevant products, one may start to feel that the web is getting a bit too familiar.

Such information is also of interest to other parties, like your insurance company. If they know you have been looking at skydiving sites or forums for congenital diseases, your premiums may mysteriously start going up.  Potential employers or landlords may turn you down based on their concerns about your web interests. In extreme instances, the police or tax authorities may develop an interest without you ever having committed a crime, simply based on suspicious surfing.

How do they track us?
---------------------

Every time you load a web page, the server software on the web site generates a record of the page viewed in a log file. This is not always a bad thing. When you log in to a website, there is a need for a way to establish your identity and keep track of who you are in order to save your preferences, or present you with customized information. It does this by passing a small file to your browser and storing a corresponding reference on the web server. This file is called a *cookie*. It sounds tasty but the problem is that this information stays on your computer even after leaving the web site and may phone home to tell the owner of the cookie about other web sites you are visiting. Some major sites, like Facebook and Google have been caught using them to keep track of your browsing even after you have logged out.

How can I prevent tracking?
---------------------------

The simplest and most direct way to deal with tracking is to delete the cookie files in your browser. You can install an extension that deletes cookies automatically or you can delete cookies yourself. We've discussed this in 'Safer Browsing'.


A word of warning
-----------------

If you block trackers, you will have a higher level of privacy when surfing the net. However, government agencies, bosses, hackers and unscrupulous network administrators will still be able to intercept your traffic and see what you are looking at. Blocking trackers and using bunch of extensions may lead to a unique fingerprint as well. If you want to secure your connections you will need to use TLS. Your identity may also be visible to other people on the internet. If you want to thoroughly protect your identity while browsing, you will need to take steps toward online anonymity which is explained in another section of this book.
