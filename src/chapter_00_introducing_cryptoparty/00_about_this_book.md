About This Book
===============

The CryptoParty Handbook was born from a suggestion by Marta Peirano ([http://petitemedia.es](http://petitemedia.es)) and Adam Hyde ([http://booksprints.net](http://booksprints.net)) after the first Berlin CryptoParty, held on the 29th of August, 2012. Julian Oliver ([http://julianoliver.com](http://julianoliver.com)) and Danja Vasiliev ([http://k0a1a.net](http://k0a1a.net)), co-organisers of the Berlin CryptoParty along with Marta were very enthusiastic about the idea, seeing a need for a practical working book with a low entry-barrier to use in subsequent parties. Asher Wolf, originator of the CryptoParty movement, was then invited to run along and the project was born.

This book was written in the first 3 days of October 2012 at Studio Weise7, Berlin, surrounded by fine food and a small ocean of coffee. Approximately 20 people were involved in its creation, some more than others, some local and some far.

The writing methodology used, BookSprint ([http://booksprints.net](http://booksprints.net)), is all about minimising any obstruction between expertise and the published page. Face-to-face discussion and dynamic task-assignment were a huge part of getting the job done, like any good CryptoParty!

The open source, web-based (HTML5 and CSS) writing platform BookType ([http://booktype.pro](http://booktype.pro)) was chosen for the editing task, helping such a tentacular feat of parallel development to happen with relative ease. Asher also opened a couple of TitanPad pages to crowd-source the Manifesto and HowTo CryptoParty chapters.

Combined, this became the official CryptoParty Handbook by midnight October the 3rd, GMT+1.
