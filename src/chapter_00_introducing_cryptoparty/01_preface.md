Preface
=======

This book is a collective and ongoing effort in that it is based on the two [FLOSS Manuals](https://www.flossmanuals.net) [How to Bypass Internet Censorship](https://flossmanuals.net/bypassing-censorship) and [Basic Internet Security](https://flossmanuals.net/basic-internet-security/) and collaboratively edited on [Github](https://github.com/cryptoparty/handbook) although other venues of collaborative editing are investigated.

Its goal is to give a comprehensive resource to people who would like to attend or organize a CryptoParty but lack the local expertise or just confidence in doing so. All chapters are designed to be self-contained.
