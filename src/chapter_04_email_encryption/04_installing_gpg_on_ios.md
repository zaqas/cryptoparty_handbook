Installing GPG On iOS
===

Be aware that using a proprietary operating systems to encrypt/decrypt your messages is not recommended. It's also best to use a desktop computer or a laptop instead of a mobile device since mobile devices track your every movement so they can build a profile on you.

Also configuring a laptop or a computer to be more private is far easier than configuring a closed source system like iOS.

If you have no choice and you want to use an iOS device, we can name few options. Here are your options:

- [iPGMail](https://ipgmail.com/) (Proprietary)
- [PGPro](https://pgpro.app/) (Open Source)
- [PGP Everywhere](http://pgpeverywhere.com/) (Proprietary)
