Attending Protests
===

Sometimes people have to express their dissatisfaction or disgust with an action through organizing a protest. People have the right to protest peacefully but in some regions, the state doesn't respect people's rights and therefore people have to protect themselves against the state.

When it comes to attending protests, it's important to know your role and what is going to happen to you. Are you going to be arrested? be photographed?

The tools you need for each of these situations is different and your mindset should differ as well. 

Encrypt your device
---

Ensure your device is encrypted. Although there are rumors that cops can break into your device even if it's encrypted, you should still encrypt your device. Most devices are encrypted by default nowadays. If your device is not encrypted by default there should be an option in the settings that allows full disk encryption. Enable it.


Use a disposable phone
---

We advise you to buy a cheap and disposable smartphone and use that during the protest. If you lose it, you don't have to worry about your data. If you lose it, you don't need to worry about your data. Buy a prepaid SIM card (using cash) and remember to disable features that aren't necessary.

Use a strong password
---

Don't use your face or your fingerprint to unlock your device. Use a strong and complex password. Don't write it on a piece of paper. If memorizing bunch of random characters is difficult, use an easy-to-remember passphrase.

Use Signal
---

We have already covered how to install and use Signal. Tell your friends to install it as well. You can set your messages to disappear after a while. Signal uses end-to-end encryption to protect your privacy and many high-profile people rely on it.


Things to Consider
---

If you're taking pictures, it's important to blur faces of other protesters. Scrub metadata before uploading your files on the internet. Be aware that your physical security is important as well. Take the necessary measures to protect yourself. There are other guides on the internet and you should look them up as well. For example EFF has a great guide, you find it here: [https://ssd.eff.org/en/module/attending-protest](https://ssd.eff.org/en/module/attending-protest)
