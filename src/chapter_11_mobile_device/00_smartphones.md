Smartphones
============

Nowadays we carry our cellphones everywhere. We take them to our bed, to our meetings, to our home. These devices have become a necessity and they are very convenient.

You check your Instagram, tweet about what you're thinking, check your bank account, call a friend, watch a video on Youtube. But all of these conveniences comes at a cost. The apps you have on your smartphone collect a vast amount of information on you. 

These information could be very intimate and intrusive (religion, sexual orientation, marital status) and companies use these information to show you personalized advertisement.

Eventually your data will be breached and your personal details would be on public domain. When something goes online, there's no way to take it offline.

If you're attending a protest and you're carrying a smartphone, this device could be used to identify you even if you're disguised.

In this part we're going to discuss things you can do to minimize your exposure. A great solution would be not to use a smartphone but many people can't do this because their work requires them to carry a smartphone.
