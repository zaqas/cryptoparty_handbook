How To Stay Secure
===

When it comes to security, you have to define what is your threat model and what steps you can take to protect yourself against your adversary.

There are basic things that you can do that are very useful and we will cover them here:

1. Use Faraday bags. When you put your smartphone in a faraday bag, no one is able to call you because cell towers are unable to locate you. Faraday bags are great and they're very effective, ensure that your faraday bag works perfectly before using it.

2. If you're not using an application on your smartphone, delete it. You can always re-install it.

3. Keep your smartphone up-to-date. it's important to update your applications whenever there is an update. Don't postpone it. 

4. Check permissions. Many apps have uncontrolled access to your device and can access your microphone, camera, etc. A calendar doesn't need to know your location or have access to your microphone.

5. Many malicious application come in shape of a calendar or a game. Don't give unlimited access to any application.

6. Use a VPN. We already covered VPN's and how they can be used to protect your privacy. Choose a VPN service that has a kill-switch. All of your traffic should be encrypted.

7. Cover your camera. If you already disabled camera access for your apps but you're still paranoid you can use a tape to cover your camera.

8. Remove the microphone. This solution is hardcore but at the same time very effective. If you already disabled microphone access but you think your adversary is capable of bypassing that, remove the microphone. When you need to talk to someone, use a headphone.

9. Use a firewall. Having a firewall on your devices shows you what requests are being sent by the applications on your phone and you can block them. Choose a firewall which is open source and reputable.

10. Disable Wi-Fi when you're not using it. Apps use WiFi to communicate with their servers. Disable Wi-Fi to reduce the amount of information sent.

11. Disable advertising permissions to the greatest extent possible.

12. If your device has a feature like "Find My Device", turn it off.

13. Limit web browsing. Try to stay away from browsing on your smartphone as it's more difficult to protect your privacy on your smartphone rather than a laptop. On a laptop you could use Tails to browse the web but on your smartphone it's very difficult to stay safe.

14. Leave it at home. If you're going for a walk with your dog, leave your phone at home. You don't need to carry your smartphone everywhere. The more you carry your smartphone, the more information your smartphone has on you.
