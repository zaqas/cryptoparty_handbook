Why Firefox?
============

Firefox is a free and open-source web browser developed developed by the Mozilla Foundation. 

As such, it is independent from the interests of any one specific company although a [large portion of its funding comes from Google](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mozilla_Foundation#Financing) for its placement as the default search engine within the Firefox browser. 


It is also highly extensible through the add-ons and plugins and you can also tweak it. It should however be noted that this extensibility through add-ons is a double-edged sword and as such add-ons also have great power to subvert the browsers normal activities as well as enhance them.

If you are uncomfortable with Google as the default search engine, this can be changed. Some more pro-privacy search engines that are worth considering are [Qwant](https://www.qwant.com/), [DuckDuckGo](https://duckduckgo.com/) and [SwissCows](https://swisscows.com/). We'll talk about changing your search engine later.
